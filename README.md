# post_win_inst

**A small Powershell script to automate install of my favorite apps post Windows install.**

Installs and uses [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install the following apps:
- [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2102-x64.exe)
- [Borderless Gaming](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases/latest)
- [Firefox](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-stub&os=win&lang=en-US)
- [GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/download/)
- [Mozilla VPN](https://vpn.mozilla.org/r/vpn/download/windows)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/windows/)
- [Steam](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64)
- [WinDirStat](https://sourceforge.net/projects/windirstat/files/latest/download)

Feel free to use this script.
Of course, you shouldn't run this blindly, so look through the script before running an untrusted script with admin privileges.
