# post_win_inst

**A small Powershell script to automate install of a few of my most used apps**~~, for after I inevitably have to reinstall Windows.~~

Installs and uses [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install the following apps:
- [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
- [Borderless Gaming](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/)
- [GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/)
- [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/)

Feel free to use this script.
Of course, you shouldn't run this blindly, so look through the script before running an untrusted script with admin privileges.
